## Rules you should know
If you’re reading this page of the guide, I’ll assume you have completed the tutorial levels and that you understand all the concepts therein. But just in case, I’ll write all those concepts here. If any of them feel shaky to you, return to the appropriate levels to experiment some more.

* [Noun] is [Property]: It’s what the whole game is about so if you don’t get this you’re going to have a bad time.

* You (Levels 02 and 06)

* Win (Levels 01, 02, and 03)

* Stop (all of them)

* Push (levels 04 and 05)

* Sink (level 03)

* Hot and Melt (level 05)

* Defeat (levels 04 and 06)

* How to create two statements with only one “Is.”

Reminder: Bold text refers to rules themselves. Italics refer to the objects affected by rules - every one of them in the level. Regular text only refers to specific instances of those objects. “Quoted text” refers to the actual noun, property, and connecting word text you can interact with on the level. All hints are invisible until you highlight text.

## The Lake

{{< figure src="/images/the-lake-1.png" title=It’s the only place you can go. >}}
{{< figure src="/images/the-lake-2.png" title=Initial Lake Map >}}

Each world has a dozen or so puzzles, but you don’t need to solve all of them. You only need to clear 8 of the 15 puzzles in The Lake. If you want to complete the world, but some of the puzzles give you trouble, you can always leave and come back. I recommend completing through level 11 on your first visit so you understand all the concepts you need. You might need to return later for levels 12-13 and the extras.

Notice also how the map is divided into three distinct sections: bottom, top, and right. Each section deals with a different mechanic. The bottom section teaches the operator And; the top teaches Open and Shut; and the right section deals with transformations.

## Lake 01: Icy Waters

{{< figure src="/images/the-lake-lv01.png" >}}

**難易度**: ☆

**新物件**：noun Jelly; property And.

What properties does Baba have at level start? So, how does And work? Just for fun, try replacing the “Sink” with “Wall.” What happens here? Is it different from what you expected? How does the game parse a sentence with And?

What can you do with that extra "Wall"?

## Lake 02: Turns

{{< figure src="/images/the-lake-lv02.png" >}}

**難易度**: ☆

**新物件**：nouns Crab, Star. In this case “Star” refers to the Starfish object. In other worlds “Star” refers to the outline of a Star.

Some puzzles in this game seem to be made of a series of smaller puzzles. In these cases, you need to figure out what those smaller puzzles are and then solve them in sequence. It’s much easier to break things down into their smaller parts. For this level, you have two puzzles: how will you get Baba past the Skull, and how will you reach the Flag? Solve one at a time.

{{< admonition type=tip title="提示 💡" open=false >}}
You is never going to walk across the Walls.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=tip title="提示 💡💡" open=false >}}
There are three potential obstacles: the Rock, the Star, and the Skull. Which one has properties you cannot change? Which one do you need to get rid of?
